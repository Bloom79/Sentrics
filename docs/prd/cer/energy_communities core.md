# Product Requirements Document: Energy Communities (CER) Module

## 1. Overview

The Energy Communities (CER) module is designed to manage Italy's renewable energy communities (Comunità Energetiche Rinnovabili – CER). These communities consist of citizens, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), local authorities, and other eligible organizations that collectively produce, share, and optimize renewable energy. The module's objectives are to enable efficient energy sharing, manage incentive distribution (including the tariff incentivante and ARERA contributions), and ensure full regulatory compliance with requirements established by the GSE, ARERA, and other national authorities.

Key goals include:
- **Maximizing self-consumption and shared energy:** Through both physical (direct) and virtual (metering-based) self-consumption.
- **Facilitating citizen participation:** Enabling even non-expert users to join and benefit from renewable energy generation.
- **Supporting regulatory reporting and incentive management:** In accordance with the latest Italian and EU guidelines.

## 2. Regulatory and Conceptual Framework

### 2.1 European and National Legislation

CER configurations are established under the framework of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II, 2018/2001) and the Internal Market for Electricity Directive (2019/944). Italy has transposed these directives through several measures:
- **Decreto Milleproroghe (DL 162/2019)** – the initial phase of transposition, later converted into Law n.8/2020.
- **Decreto Legislativo 199/2021** – which significantly increased the maximum allowable capacity for each renewable installation from 200 kW to 1 MW and extended the network eligibility from the secondary to the primary cabina.
- **Decreto CER (DM n. 414/2023)** – recently approved to detail the incentive mechanisms (tariffa incentivante and contributi in conto capitale) supporting CER development, including provisions tied to the PNRR for communities in municipalities with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants.

These legislative instruments mandate that all production and consumption units in a CER be geographically co‑locatable – typically connected to the same transformer station (cabina primaria) – ensuring minimal transmission losses and a uniform framework for virtual self‑consumption.

### 2.2 Key Definitions and Energy Flow Concepts

A CER is structured around the model of **autoconsumo diffuso (diffuse self‑consumption)**. Key definitions include:
- **Energia condivisa (Shared Energy):** The energy that is produced by renewable installations and "shared" among community members. It is calculated on an hourly basis as the minimum between the total renewable production and the aggregate consumption of all connected units.
- **Energia autoconsumata (Self‑Consumed Energy):** Energy that is consumed directly at the site of production (autoconsumo fisico) without entering the incentive scheme.
- **Energia incentivata (Incentivized Energy):** The portion of shared energy that qualifies for economic incentives, as determined by tariff rules established by ARERA and the Decreto CER.

This final document offers a detailed roadmap for the development and deployment of a digital platform to manage renewable energy communities in Italy, ensuring compliance with current legislation, integration of advanced energy management technologies, and fostering an inclusive, efficient, and sustainable energy ecosystem.

## 4. Organizational and Legal Structure

### 4.1 Legal Form and Governance

CERs must be established as autonomous legal entities (e.g., associazioni non riconosciute, cooperative, società a responsabilità limitata, società benefit) with a primary social purpose of generating collective benefits rather than profit. The founding documents (atto costitutivo and statuto) must include:
- **Clear Objectives:** Prioritize environmental, social, and economic benefits.
- **Membership Rules:** Define who can participate. Eligible members include citizens, PMIs (provided that energy production is not their core business), local authorities, research institutions, and certain non-profit organizations. Large enterprises and companies in specific sectors (e.g., ATECO 35.11.00/35.14.00) are typically excluded from holding control.
- **Governance and Control:** The statute must ensure that decision-making power remains with eligible members and that participation is open and voluntary, with clear provisions for recesso (exit) and the equitable distribution of benefits.
- **Designation of a Referente:** A specific figure or entity is designated as responsible for interfacing with external bodies (e.g., the GSE) and for managing the internal administrative, technical, and financial operations of the CER.

### 4.2 Organizational Models and Examples

The literature and recent guides distinguish several models:
- **CER Industriali:** Groups of companies operating in the same industrial area, sharing surplus energy from on-site renewable installations.
- **CER Miste:** Mixed communities where citizens, enterprises, and local authorities join together.
- **CER in Partenariato Pubblico-Privato (PPP):** These leverage project financing and public support to deploy and manage larger installations.

## 5. Economic Incentives and Energy Valuation

### 5.1 Incentive Mechanisms

Recent legislative measures (e.g., Decreto CER, DM n. 414/2023) define the following incentive schemes:
- **Tariffa Incentivante (Incentive Tariff):**  
  A premium tariff is paid on the shared energy. The tariff is composed of a fixed part and a variable part (which decreases as the zonal price increases). Maximum values depend on the plant size:
  - ≤200 kW: up to 120 €/MWh,
  - >200 kW and ≤600 kW: up to 110 €/MWh,
  - >600 kW and ≤1 MW: up to 100 €/MWh.  
  Additional regional adjustments are applied (e.g., +4 €/MWh for Central Italy, +10 €/MWh for Northern Italy).
- **Contributi in Conto Capitale:**  
  For CERs in municipalities with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants, a grant of up to 40% of eligible costs is available under the PNRR, subject to thresholds on total renewable capacity (e.g., at least 2 GW installed and 2,500 GWh annual production).

### 5.2 Energy Performance Metrics

CER economic evaluation relies on performance indicators that include:
- **Indice di Autoconsumo Fisico:** The ratio of directly self-consumed energy at the production site.
- **Indice di Autoconsumo Virtuale:** The proportion of energy shared (via virtual metering) among community members.
- **Energia Condivisa, Autoconsumata, e Incentivata:** These metrics are computed hourly using data from all connected production and consumption units.
- **Valorizzazione dell'Autoconsumo:** Based on avoided grid costs and the tariffa incentivante, computed using formulas that include variable components (e.g., TRAS_E and BTAU) and adjustments for losses and market conditions.
