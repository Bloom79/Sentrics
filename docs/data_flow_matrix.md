**Key Columns Explained:**
1. **Criticality:** 
   - *Critical*: Directly impacts real-time grid stability or market revenues
   - *High*: Affects daily operations and asset health
   - *Medium*: Used for planning and optimization
   - *Low*: Historical/reference data

2. **Data Type Classification:**
   - Time-series: Streaming operational measurements
   - Control commands: Operational instructions
   - Models: Digital twin/AI model updates
   - Financial: Cost/revenue-related metrics

3. **Frequency Guidelines:**
   - Real-time: Sub-second to 5-second intervals
   - Near-real-time: 5-second to 1-minute
   - Batch: 15-minute to daily intervals
   - On-demand: Triggered by specific events

This matrix aligns with the multi-layered architecture shown in the flowchart, particularly supporting:
1. **Asset Lifecycle Manager**: Through degradation data, maintenance triggers, and health reports
2. **Power Optimization**: Via real-time operational data, market signals, and adaptive setpoints
3. **Predictive Maintenance**: Enabled by anomaly detection and digital twin updates
4. **Market Compliance**: Supported by contextualized telemetry and regulatory reporting
